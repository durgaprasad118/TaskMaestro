## How does it work?
- A user can sign up and signin using google and 
- You will be taken to the home page by default
- When you click `go to dashboard` or `Tasks` it navigates to the task view page
-  **Add Task** : Allows us to add a task 
   -  We can add due date, title, subTasks, labels..
   -  if the task date is greater than today it moves to `to-do` section by default
   -  if the due date of the task is lesser then it moves to the `backlog` section automatically
-  **Update Task** : Update task allows us to update all the feilds 
   -  Similarly in the add todo depending on the due date the task is moved to their corresponding sections.
   -  If there are one or more done sub-tasks then it moves to `progress` else remains in the `to-do` section.
   -  We can toggle the todo status there is a checkbox to mark it as done.
      -  If we mark it as done it moves to the `done` section and if we uncheck it depending on the subtasks(if one or more done moves to `progress` else `to-do`) the sections are changed.
-  **Delete Task** : On clicking update we can see a `delete-button` which removes from the dashboard and the database and auto refreshes.
-  **Analytics Section** : There is an analytics section which shows a chart view depending on the tasks and the sub-tasks count.
   -  It updates along with the tasks.
-  **Debounced Search Bar** : A debounced search bar is enabled for searching the tasks  
-  **Change Status**: When we drag to the desired section the task stays there.
   - If the task is moved to `Done` section it automatically marks as done
   - If we move away from `Done` 
     -  First due date is checked if it passes the current date then moves to `Backlog`
     -  If that is not the case it moves to `progress` and `to-do` according to the number of subtasks tasks avilable.
- Every day at 12:00 AM there is a [cron-job](cron-job.org) running which checks the due date of the task.
  - if the due date passes current date then the task is moved to `backlog` else it stays where it is.
- All the tasks will be in descending order of the dates. Like the task with nearest date will be on the top.
